# Overview
In this data analytics project I was tasked by Jack, the head of analytics for the User Interface team at PlanMyTrip, asked me to help collect data to present regarding customers search page queries and their perferred travel criteria. Included in this github repository is the Python script, csv data files, and various images that show vacation locations based on a wide range of metrics.
